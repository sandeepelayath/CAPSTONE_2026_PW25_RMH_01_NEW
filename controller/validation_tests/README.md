# Mitigation System Validation Tests

This directory contains comprehensive validation tests for the Risk-Based Mitigation Manager system. These tests verify that the network security system makes accurate decisions and logs them properly.

## Test Suite Components

### 1. `test_mitigation_accuracy.py`
**Purpose**: Validates the accuracy of security mitigation decisions

**Test Cases**:
- ✅ **Whitelist Host Traffic** - Ensures whitelisted hosts are allowed
- 🚫 **Blacklisted Host Traffic** - Ensures blacklisted hosts are blocked  
- 🍯 **Honeypot Access Attempts** - Validates maximum security response
- 🟢 **Low Risk Traffic** - Confirms low-risk flows are allowed
- 🔴 **High Risk Traffic** - Ensures high-risk flows are mitigated
- 🟡 **Medium Risk Traffic** - Validates rate limiting for medium risk

### 2. `validate_json_logs.py`
**Purpose**: Validates log file integrity and decision consistency

**Validation Areas**:
- 📋 **Risk Actions Log** - Validates structure and content of mitigation decisions
- 🚨 **Anomaly Detection Log** - Ensures proper ML detection logging
- 🔄 **Cross-Validation** - Confirms consistency between different logs
- 📊 **Pattern Analysis** - Analyzes decision patterns and distributions

### 3. `run_validation_tests.py`
**Purpose**: Orchestrates all validation tests and generates comprehensive reports

**Features**:
- Executes both accuracy and log validation tests
- Generates detailed JSON reports
- Provides system recommendations
- Calculates overall system health scores

## Usage

### Prerequisites

The test suite can run in two modes:

#### Mode 1: **Real Data Validation** (Preferred for production)
1. **Generate Real Log Data**: Run the Ryu controller first to create log files
   ```bash
   cd ../
   ryu-manager ryu_controller.py
   # Let it run and process some network traffic
   # Stop with Ctrl+C after generating logs
   ```

2. **Required Log Files**:
   - `../risk_mitigation_actions.json`
   - `../anomaly_log.json`

#### Mode 2: **Synthetic Data Testing** (Automatic fallback)
If no log files exist, the test suite will **automatically generate comprehensive synthetic test data** covering:
- ✅ **Normal legitimate traffic** scenarios
- 🟡 **Low-risk suspicious** activity patterns  
- 🟠 **Medium-risk threats** requiring rate limiting
- 🔴 **High-risk attacks** triggering blocks
- 🍯 **Honeypot access attempts** with maximum penalties
- 📋 **Policy scenarios** (blacklist/whitelist testing)

**No manual setup required** - just run the tests!

### Running Tests

#### Option 1: Run All Tests (Recommended)
```bash
cd validation_tests
python run_validation_tests.py
```

#### Option 2: Run Individual Test Suites
```bash
# Test mitigation accuracy only
python test_mitigation_accuracy.py

# Test log validation only  
python validate_json_logs.py
```

### Making Files Executable (Optional)
```bash
chmod +x *.py
./run_validation_tests.py
```

## Generated Reports

After running tests, the following reports are generated:

### 1. `mitigation_accuracy_report.json`
- Detailed results of each mitigation accuracy test
- Pass/fail status for each test case
- Expected vs actual outcomes
- Recommendations for improvement

### 2. `json_log_validation_report.json`
- Log file integrity analysis
- Data consistency validation results
- Pattern analysis and statistics
- Cross-validation findings

### 3. `comprehensive_validation_report.json`
- Overall system assessment
- Combined accuracy metrics
- Issues identification
- Production readiness evaluation

## Interpreting Results

### Accuracy Thresholds

**Mitigation Accuracy**:
- 🏆 **≥90%**: Excellent - Production ready
- ✅ **≥75%**: Good - Acceptable for deployment  
- ⚠️ **≥50%**: Fair - Needs improvement
- ❌ **<50%**: Poor - Requires immediate attention

**Log Validation**:
- 🏆 **≥95%**: Excellent log integrity
- ✅ **≥85%**: Good with minor issues
- ⚠️ **≥70%**: Fair - needs improvement  
- ❌ **<70%**: Poor - significant issues

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Low Mitigation Accuracy**:
- Check ML model thresholds in `mitigation_manager.py`
- Validate training data quality
- Review risk score calculation logic
- Consider model retraining

**Log Validation Failures**:
- Check JSON formatting in log files
- Verify required fields are present
- Ensure timestamp formats are correct
- Validate IP address formats

**Cross-Validation Issues**:
- Check temporal correlation between logs
- Verify source IP consistency
- Ensure high-confidence anomalies trigger actions

## Test Development

### Adding New Test Cases

To add new mitigation accuracy tests:

1. **Add test method** to `MitigationAccuracyValidator` class:
   ```python
   def test_new_scenario(self):
       """Test Case N: Description"""
       # Setup test conditions
       # Execute mitigation
       # Validate results
       # Record test result
   ```

2. **Register test** in `run_validation_tests()` method

3. **Update documentation** with new test case description

### Customizing Validation Rules

Modify validation rules in `validate_json_logs.py`:

- **Risk thresholds**: Update `_validate_risk_action_consistency()`
- **Required fields**: Modify `required_fields` lists
- **Pattern matching**: Update validation logic in test methods

## Troubleshooting

### Import Errors
```bash
# Ensure you're in the validation_tests directory
cd validation_tests
python -c "import sys; print(sys.path)"
```

### Missing Log Files  
```bash
# Check if log files exist
ls -la ../risk_mitigation_actions.json ../anomaly_log.json

# If missing, run controller first
cd ../
ryu-manager ryu_controller.py
```

### Permission Issues
```bash
# Make files executable
chmod +x *.py

# Or run with python explicitly
python run_validation_tests.py
```

## Integration with CI/CD

These tests can be integrated into continuous integration pipelines:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# CI/CD integration script
cd validation_tests

# Run comprehensive validation
python run_validation_tests.py

# Check exit code
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "✅ Validation passed - System ready for deployment"
    exit 0
else
    echo "❌ Validation failed - Review reports before deployment"
    exit 1
fi
```

## Contributing

When adding new tests or validation rules:

1. **Follow naming conventions**: `test_*` for test methods
2. **Add comprehensive documentation**: Docstrings and comments
3. **Include error handling**: Graceful failure handling
4. **Update this README**: Document new test cases and features
5. **Test your tests**: Validate test logic with known scenarios

## Support

For issues or questions about validation tests:

1. **Check logs**: Review generated JSON reports for details
2. **Verify prerequisites**: Ensure log files exist and are valid
3. **Review documentation**: Check test case descriptions
4. **Test individual components**: Run tests separately to isolate issues
